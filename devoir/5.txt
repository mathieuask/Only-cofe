To
 
effectively
 
plan
 
and
 
monitor
 
the
 
Pop-Up
 
Café
 
project,
 
a
 
cost
 
schedule
 
was
 
created
 
to
 
estimate
 
both
 
the
 
duration
 
and
 
cost
 
of
 
each
 
major
 
work
 
package.
 
This
 
schedule
 
provides
 
the
 
foundation
 
for
 
calculating
 
the
 
Planned
 
Value
 
(PV)
 
the
 
budgeted
 
cost
 
of
 
work
 
that
 
should
 
have
 
been
 
completed
 
at
 
a
 
specific
 
point
 
in
 
time.
 
 
Each
 
work
 
package
 
was
 
first
 
analyzed
 
using
 
the
 
PERT
 
(Program
 
Evaluation
 
and
 
Review
 
Technique)
 
method,
 
which
 
incorporates
 
three
 
time
 
estimates
 
to
 
reduce
 
uncertainty:
 
 
●
 
Optimistic
 
(a)
 
–
 
the
 
shortest
 
possible
 
duration
 
 
●
 
Most
 
likely
 
(m)
 
–
 
the
 
expected
 
realistic
 
duration
 
 
●
 
Pessimistic
 
(b)
 
–
 
the
 
longest
 
possible
 
duration
 
 
The
 
expected
 
time
 
for
 
each
 
activity
 
was
 
calculated
 
using
 
the
 
standard
 
PERT
 
formula
 
 
This
 
approach
 
allows
 
for
 
a
 
more
 
balanced
 
and
 
statistically
 
realistic
 
estimate
 
compared
 
to
 
a
 
single-point
 
estimate.
 
Once
 
the
 
expected
 
duration
 
was
 
determined,
 
it
 
was
 
multiplied
 
by
 
a
 
standard
 
hourly
 
rate
 
of
 
€20/hour
 
to
 
determine
 
the
 
budgeted
 
cost
 
for
 
each
 
work
 
package.
 
This
 
produced
 
a
 
detailed
 
list
 
of
 
all
 
planned
 
tasks
 
with
 
their
 
estimated
 
costs,
 
forming
 
the
 
project’s
 
baseline
 
budget.
 
 
After
 
estimating
 
the
 
cost
 
of
 
each
 
task,
 
a
 
weekly
 
cost
 
schedule
 
was
 
developed
 
over
 
a
 
six-week
 
timeline,
 
corresponding
 
to
 
the
 
project’s
 
major
 
phases
 
from
 
preparation
 
and
 
setup
 
to
 
launch
 
and
 
evaluation.
 
 
 
Each
 
week’s
 
PV
 
represents
 
the
 
total
 
budgeted
 
cost
 
of
 
all
 
tasks
 
scheduled
 
for
 
that
 
period.
 
The
 
cumulative
 
PV
 
shows
 
how
 
the
 
project’s
 
planned
 
spending
 
grows
 
over
 
time,
 
forming
 
the
 
BCWS
 
(Budgeted
 
Cost
 
of
 
Work
 
Scheduled)
 
curve
 
used
 
in
 
Earned
 
Value
 
Management.
 
 
This
 
structured
 
cost
 
schedule
 
enables
 
the
 
project
 
team
 
to:
 
 
●
 
Track
 
financial
 
progress
 
objectively;
 
 
●
 
Identify
 
schedule
 
delays
 
or
 
cost
 
overruns
 
early;
 
 
●
 
Compare
 
actual
 
performance
 
(EV
 
and
 
AC,
 
later
 
in
 
the
 
project)
 
against
 
planned
 
performance
 
(PV).
 
 
In
 
summary,
 
the
 
cost
 
schedule
 
and
 
Planned
 
Value
 
together
 
provide
 
a
 
clear
 
financial
 
roadmap
 
for
 
the
 
project.
 
They
 
establish
 
the
 
budget
 
baseline,
 
align
 
financial
 
planning
 
with
 
the
 
work
 
schedule,
 
and
 
ensure
 
that
 
the
 
Pop-Up
 
Café
 
project
 
remains
 
both
 
on
 
time
 
and
 
within
 
budget
 
throughout
 
its
 
implementation.
 
Here
 
are
 
the
 
two
 
tables

We
 
choose
 
an
 
agile
 
appr oach
 
for
 
the
 
Pop-Up
 
Café
 
project
 
because
 
it
 
allows
 
flexibility
 
and
 
quick
 
adjustments
 
during
 
implementation.
 
The
 
project
 
involves
 
uncertainties
 
such
 
as
 
customer
 
demand,
 
supplier
 
reliability ,
 
and
 
weather
 
conditions.
 
Agile
 
enables
 
iterative
 
improvements
 
based
 
on
 
feedback
 
and
 
fits
 
well
 
with
 
a
 
short
 
project
 
duration
 
and
 
a
 
small
 
student
 
team.
 
A
 
traditional
 
waterfall
 
approach
 
would
 
be
 
too
 
rigid
 
and
 
wouldn’ t
 
allow
 
necessary
 
changes
 
during
 
execution.
