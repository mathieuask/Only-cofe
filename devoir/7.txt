DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF TOP 5 RISKS
RISK #1: Permit Delays
Project requires multiple authorizations (campus temporary occupation, health certificate, DDPP declaration). Administrative
delays in Reims can be long.
Frequency: 7/10 - French administration known for delays. Little margin on short project.
Impact: 9/10 - Without permits, project cannot start. Risk of cancellation.
Mitigation: Contact city hall and campus from week 1; Prepare documents in advance; Weekly follow-up; Identify key
contacts.
Contingency: 2-week buffer in schedule; Plan B: "distribution only" model with pre-packaged goods; Negotiate partial
opening.
RISK #2: Unreliable Suppliers
Regular deliveries needed (coffee, milk, cups). A failing supplier paralyzes operations.
Frequency: 6/10 - Local suppliers may have stock/logistics issues for small orders.
Impact: 7/10 - Without stock, cannot serve customers. Revenue loss and credibility damage.
Mitigation: List 2-3 backup suppliers per product; Order 3-4 days ahead; Clear contracts; Check references.
Contingency: Emergency contacts (Metro, Reims suppliers); 2-day safety stock; Supermarket purchase as last resort.
RISK #3: Low Customer Demand
If <50-100 customers/day, revenue does not cover costs. Concept may not interest students or communication insufficient.
Frequency: 5/10 - Innovative project but uncertain attraction. Depends on marketing.
Impact: 8/10 - Low traffic = financial failure and unmet objectives.
Mitigation: Intensive marketing 2 weeks before; Student partnerships; Competitive prices (€1.50 vs €3); Attractive opening
offer; Strategic location.
Contingency: Reduce hours if few customers; Flash promotions (happy hour); Events (quiz, music); Adjust menu.
RISK #4: Staff Absence or Poorly Trained
Café depends on volunteer/low-paid students. Possible absences (exams, illness) or lack of service mastery.
Frequency: 6/10 - Students = variable schedule, low professional reliability.
Impact: 6/10 - Degraded service, unhappy customers, but project team can compensate.
Mitigation: 3-4h training 2 days before opening; Simple manual; 2-3 backup people; Clear schedule; Buddy system.
Contingency: 5 team members (Mathieu, Tanguy, Martin, Albin, Felix) ready to replace; Simplify tasks; Internal replacement.
RISK #5: Budget Overrun
Costs may explode (expensive equipment, wasted stock, costly permits). Student budget tight.
Frequency: 7/10 - First entrepreneurial project = poor estimation of real costs.
Impact: 6/10 - May reduce project duration or quality, rarely fatal.
Mitigation: Detailed budget with 15% margin; Weekly Excel tracking; Negotiate student discounts; Sponsors/university
support; Prioritization.
Contingency: Reduce hours to save; Simplify menu; Increase prices if necessary; Student crowdfunding.
