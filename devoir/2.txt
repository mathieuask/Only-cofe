1 PROJECT  AND  PRODUCT  OVERVIEW  
Only Café  is a pilot project that sets up a minimalist, pop -up coffee shop in the busiest spot 
on each campus (one café per campus, two campuses in total). Open from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., 
it offers students and professors a simple, efficient coffee break: four types of  coffee in 
three sizes (€1.50, €2.00, €2.50), with no pastries or distractions.  
The idea? A space to enjoy a good coffee in just two minutes, sit down to chat, or get 
some light work done, all in a relaxed atmosphere.  
When?  A 6-month trial to test the concept’s viability.  
Estimated budget:  ~€5,000 (equipment, coffee, student staff).  
Goal:  Sell 150 coffees per day per campus, and create a natural meeting spot between 
classes in the heart of campus life.  
 
2 JUSTIFICATION  
2.1 BUSINESS  NEED  
Students and professors have no healthy space for their breaks, often resorting to smoking  
areas or hallways. According to them, the current coffee machines do not provide coffee of  
sufficient quality. Only Café fills this gap by offering a friendly meeting place that  
encourages interaction and enhances daily life on campus.  
2.2 BUSINESS  IMPACT  
- For users: Less isolation, more social connections, and a healthy alternative  
to unproductive breaks, with the option to buy higher -quality coffee at a  
Slightly higher price than from regular vending machines  
- For the school: A better image and reputation, thanks to a more dynamic  
campus that cares about well -being.  
- Expected results: 150 coffees sold per day per campus, 80% satisfaction  
rate, and a decrease in the use of smoking areas. A project that enhances the  
student experience and boosts positive reviews.  
3 SCOPE  
3.1 OBJECTIVES

central locations by Week 3.  
• Adoption: Achieve ≥200 uses/day of the coffee corner by Week 6 (rolling 5 -day average).
